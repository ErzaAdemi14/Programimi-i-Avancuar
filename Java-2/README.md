<!-- # #AI-Assisted Components
Boilerplate Code:

Setting up the script structure, including import statements and main() function.

Basic error handling in read_csv() and general design of functions.

Adding documentation strings to provide clarity on each function's purpose.

Core Features:

Ideas for analysis types (e.g., stats calculation, histogram generation, correlation, outliers).

Use of Python's argparse module for command-line argument parsing.

Basic statistical calculations like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.

Example Usage Comments:

Suggesting various example commands that demonstrate how to interact with the script.


<!-- Modified parts by me:

Specific implementation details in generate_histogram() (like the calculation of bin ranges and text histogram format).

Fine-tuning of functions like find_outliers() to include a flexible threshold.

Personal Documentation Style:

The way you phrased docstrings to describe the behavior of your script.

Clarity and precision in user-facing error messages, such as "Columns not found." -->
